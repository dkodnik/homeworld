------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To patch the Windows source with the changes made for Homeworld SDL, you will
need a copy of the original Homeworld source code.  The source is available
from the Relic Developers Network (http://www.relic.com/rdn/) after
registering (don't worry, it's free).

- Unzip the source code into this directory.
- Run the following from the command line:

    ./prep-hw-source.sh
    cat homeworld_sdl-orig-to-0.3.patch | patch -p1

The source code should now be patched and ready for compiling.  Additional
instructions are provided in the INSTALL file included with this package.

If you want to save space, the following directories are not used by the SDL
port and can be deleted:

- documents
- EB Levels
- exe
- Lib
- obj
- sound
- tools
- src/Titan
- src/Win32
